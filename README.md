# 🌐 EmergenSite

> A crowdsourced emergency reporting platform that maps disasters in real time using user input and satellite data.

## 🧠 Inspiration
During natural disasters, many areas remain unassisted due to lack of real-time information. We wanted to empower affected individuals to **report emergencies directly**, so responders and volunteers can act fast — even in areas off the radar.

## 🚀 What It Does
EmergenSite is a **real-time disaster map** where:
- Users can **report incidents** like floods, fires, and infrastructure damage.
- Reports appear on a live map using **geolocation and timestamps**.
- We integrate **satellite data** for a larger perspective.
- Government officials, NGOs, and the public can **see high-risk zones** and act accordingly.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (map rendering and form inputs)
- **Backend**: Firebase for storing and syncing reports
- **APIs Used**: Google Maps API, Satellite imagery datasets
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Firebase Hosting
